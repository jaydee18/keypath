Keypath Test from home.

To review:

Run composer install and then import the DB provided via email.

To create the JSON data, I created a content type called "Degree" and then added a couple of nodes matching the content from the mock-up.
I then created a view with a REST endpoint.

I created a controller with a route and injected in a few services then set that as the home page.

I then followed your brief more exactly and used hook functions to inject the necessary bits into Basic Page node with a custom template.

They both are using the same CSS component.

Let me know if there are any issues.
